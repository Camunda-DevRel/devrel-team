# Camunda Developer Relations

The Camunda Developer Relations team exists to serve the Camunda developer community, from internal employees to Open Source contributors, Enterprise customers, and the broader tech community.

It is our goal to provide opportunities for developers to be more successful by making them aware of our solutions, enabling them to be successful through great experiences, and fostering a culture of collaboration.

We have a number of ways we work toward making developers be more successful, including:

* **Awareness** of our products & projects.
* **Enablement** through content and excellent experiences.
* **Engagement** (Collaboration) with other Camunda community members.

## Who Are We?

We're a globally distributed team made up of developers and tech-savvy individuals who care about the tech community. We enjoy creating diverse and inclusive communities that provide solutions for our technical audiences.

* [Josh Wulf](https://github.com/jwulf) - Developer Advocate. I write code in a lot of programming languages, but ♥️ JavaScript the most. JavaScript is not only the language that will survive the apocalypse, it's the language most likely to cause it.
